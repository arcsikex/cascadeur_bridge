    > For Cascadeur version **2023.2** use [Cascadeur Bridge 1.0.2](https://github.com/arcsikex/cascadeur_bridge/releases/tag/1.0.2)
    > 
    > For Cascadeur version **between 2022.3.1 and 2023.1** use [Cascadeur Bridge 1.0.0](https://github.com/arcsikex/cascadeur_bridge/releases/tag/1.0.0)
    >

## Usage

The addon can be accessed from the N panel of the 3D Viewport in Blender.
- In the add-on preferences, you have the option to set the display name of the N panel. This feature is particularly useful if you want to merge the user interface with a different add-on.
- **Export to Cascadeur** will export the Blender scene and import it to Cascadeur.
- **Import Action**: To import an action into the selected object, first, make sure to select an **Armature that exactly matches the one in Cascadeur**.
 This operator will import the Cascadeur scene as an fbx file, apply the imported action to the selected armature, and then delete the imported objects.
- **Import Scene** will simply import the current Cascadeur scene as an fbx file.
- **Batch Import** Similar to "Import Scene" and "Import Action", but this option allows you to import scenes or actions from **all opened scenes in Cascadeur**.
- **Cascadeur Export Settings and Blender Import/Export Settings:** The default settings are optimized for typical use, but you might need different settings based on your specific requirements. Adjust the usual Blender FBX export/import settings and the Cascadeur FBX export settings here. Once you find the settings that work for you, remember to click the Save Settings button.


## Remove the addon

To remove the addon 
- from **Blender** go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons** and click on the Remove button of the add-on.
- from **Cascadeur** 
    - go to your commands folder (*CASCADEUR PATH\resources\scripts\python\commands*) and delete the ***externals*** folder. 

## Possible issues
1. "No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"
    - Try to change the port in the Settings > Advanced section on the N panel.
    - If the addon worked previously, but suddenly stopped working with this error, restarting your computer can likely solve the issue.
2. **Wrong rotation/scale** of your mesh in Blender/Cascadeur
    - Make sure that the transform values (especially rotation and scale) of your objects are applied in Blender
    - Change the export/import settings to apply the correct orientation/scale
3. **Permission Denied error** when trying to execute function from Blender
    - **Solution:** Give execute permission to your Cascadeur install folder
4. **Cascadeur crashes**
    - **Solution:** Stop Cascadeur process from the Task Manager. Please create an [Issues](https://github.com/arcsikex/cascadeur_bridge/issues) and attach Cascadeur logs to know why the crash happened.

If you have more idea/request or you found a bug please report it in the **[Issues](https://github.com/arcsikex/cascadeur_bridge/issues)**.
